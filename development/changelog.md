# Change Log

## [Date: 2025-10-31 17:30]

Fixed authentication flow bugs and updated to Next.js 16 conventions. Fixed issue where successful sign-in and password reset operations were showing error toasts due to Next.js redirect errors being caught in try-catch blocks. Updated sign-in and reset password pages to properly handle NEXT_REDIRECT errors. Removed unnecessary client-side navigation code since redirects happen on the server. Migrated from deprecated `middleware.ts` to Next.js 16's `proxy.ts` convention, renaming the middleware export function to `proxy()`. This eliminates the Next.js 16 deprecation warning and ensures compatibility with the latest framework version.

Completed Phase 1.5 Authentication System. Implemented complete authentication flow with Supabase Auth integration. Created Supabase client utilities for client-side (`lib/supabase/client.ts`), server-side (`lib/supabase/server.ts`), and middleware (`lib/supabase/middleware.ts`) operations. Set up Next.js middleware for route protection and session management. Created auth validation schemas using Zod (`lib/validations/auth.ts`) with password strength requirements. Implemented server actions for sign-in, sign-up, sign-out, and password reset (`app/(auth)/actions.ts`). Built complete UI for authentication including sign-in page with form validation and error handling, sign-up page with email verification flow, forgot password page, reset password page, and auth error page. Created auth hooks (`lib/hooks/use-auth.ts`) for `useUser()`, `useSession()`, and `useAuth()`. Added Sonner toast notifications to root layout. Created dashboard page placeholder with sign-out functionality. All forms include proper validation, loading states, and user feedback. Middleware redirects unauthenticated users to sign-in and authenticated users away from auth pages. Updated `plan.md` to mark Phase 1.5 tasks complete.

Completed remaining tasks for Phase 1.1. Installed `nprogress` package with TypeScript types for loading indicators. Set up ESLint and Prettier configuration with project-specific rules including Prettier integration, custom TypeScript rules for unused variables and explicit any warnings, and React-specific rules. Created `.prettierrc` configuration file with formatting standards (2 spaces, semicolons, double quotes, 80 char line width). Created `.prettierignore` to exclude build artifacts and dependencies. Added npm scripts for linting (`lint`, `lint:fix`) and formatting (`format`, `format:check`). Ran formatter across all project files to ensure consistency. Phase 1.1 is now fully complete except for Supabase CLI installation and project creation which will be handled separately.

Completed Phase 1.1 Environment & Dependencies Setup. Installed all core dependencies including Supabase packages (@supabase/supabase-js, @supabase/auth-helpers-nextjs, @supabase/ssr), TanStack Query for data fetching, React Hook Form and Zod for form validation, date-fns for date utilities, clsx and tailwind-merge for className management, Headless UI for accessible components, Heroicons for icons, Sonner for notifications, and security packages (DOMPurify, validator) with their TypeScript types. Created `.env.local.example` template file with Supabase configuration placeholders. Verified TypeScript path aliases are correctly configured. Created `lib/utils.ts` with className merging utility function (`cn`). Updated `plan.md` to mark Phase 1.1 tasks as complete.

Created comprehensive development plan in `plan.md` with detailed action items organized by phase. The plan breaks down the entire roadmap into 7 phases with specific, actionable checkboxes covering foundation setup (Phase 1 with auth prioritized), Campaign Manager (Phase 2), World Building (Phase 3), System Building (Phase 4), additional features and polish (Phase 5), marketing pages (Phase 6), and testing/launch (Phase 7). Updated `copilot-instructions.md` to enforce following the phased plan, marking tasks complete with developer validation, and maintaining the changelog with dated entries for all significant changes.
